          <p>Use your mouse to hover over the sunburst and explore the Mozilla F&A programs. The innermost circle represents the evaluation years: 2016-2020 and gives an overview of the Foundation’s investments and strategy. The second layer shows the different F&A programs in operation each year. The third layer displays the Foundation’s internet health focus areas supported by the F&A programming. In other words, as you move out from the center, you will find information first about a given year, then about each program in operation within that year, and finally, what internet health areas each program supported that year.</p>
